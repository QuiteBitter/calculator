# Python Tkinter Calculator

A simple to use, neat, and fully functional calculator built using Python and Tkinter where you can perform all the
basic arithmetical operations.

## Technologies Used

1. Python - 3. X
2. Tkinter - The standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit.

## How to Use

- Run the Python file `calculator.py`.
- Click on the buttons to perform arithmetic operations.
- You can use parentheses for calculations involving priority.
- Click `AC` button to clear the display.
- Use ` < -` button to undo the last input.
- Press ` = ` to get the result.

## How to Build

1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system. Check it using `python --version` command in terminal / command
   prompt. If not, [download it from here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Since Tkinter comes pre-installed with Python 3, no additional step is required for Tkinter installation.
3. Clone or download this repository to your local system.
4. Navigate to that directory using terminal or command prompt.
5. Run `python calculator.py` to start the calculator.


Note: Above instructions are for environments where Python 3 is the only version installed. If Python 2 and Python 3,
both are installed in your environment then use `python3` instead of `python` for the above command.
